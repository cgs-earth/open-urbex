# This is a new repo under heavy development - we welcome contributions but please understand that the lead developer is new and will be slow to respond but will get back to everyone!

# Introduction
Thank you for considering contributing to urbex! No one brain can do it all - and many monkeys at typewriters theoretically can write Shakespeare.

# Why should I care about contribution guidelines?
If you are wondering why you should care about contribution guidelines because you are a cowboy misfit in a Shakespearean world - then tough cookies, lone wolf! If instead, you are looking for some information about how to contribute to this repository in a way that will help this repository grow, improve, and move past the Elizabethan Era (perhaps to steampunk?) - this is the place to be!

Here are some guidelines to make your contribution successful and easy to incorporate.

## What we are looking for in a contribution?
There are many ways to contribute - you don't even have to be an experienced Pythonista to do so. We welcome tutorials and examples of repository functionality, improving documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, and writing code to be incorporated into urbex either as an additional module or extension/bug fix for a current tool.

## What AREN'T we looking for in a contribution?
1. Mean spirited comments
2. Curses and hexes
3. Total rewrites without discussing it with repo admins.

# Ground Rules
Responsibilities
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/).
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
- All changes to the main or dev branches must be submitted through a Pull Request and approved by a repository admin.
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get admin feedback.
- Each PR should contain one feature or bugfix. Submit each additional feature or bugfix as a new PR.
- Make sure your PR is up to date with the branch its merging into before submitting - items may have shifted during your flight!
- Do not commit changes to files that are unrelated to your feature or bugfix (eg: .gitignore)
- Do not add unnecessary packages to the python environment - clear it with the admin before doing so and make sure that it is noted in your PR.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.

For any contributions:
1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. Create a pull request to merge your fork with a parent branch
4. Add admin to review and wait for approval, change requests, or a note!


# Reporting Bugs
When reporting an issue, please list the version of urbex you are using and any relevant information about your application (python version, operating system, etc). Please describe as specifically as you can what behavior you are seeing (eg: an error message? a nil return value?). Please use the template and fill it out as much as possible!

Please do not use GitHub issues to ask questions about how to use urbex. Please email an repository admin and we will endeavor to guide you as best we can.

# Submitting Features
Please follow these guidelines:
1. Submit via GitHub Issues

If you have a particular roadmap, goals, or philosophy for development, share it here.
This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the project’s needs.

2. A back-and-forth and signoff by admin and higher-ups is required to make the feature happen. To make this process easier - scope the feature, thinking through why its needed and how it might work.
3. Not all features will be accepted - but your chance of incorporation is MUCH higher the more detail you give us!

# Unsure How to Begin?
You can start by looking through beginner and help-wanted issues:
- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
